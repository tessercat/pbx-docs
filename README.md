Docs for the PBX project.

This project brings together
a few stable, high-quality
open source projects
with the goal of developing
a simple,
secure,
single-server,
self-hostable
WebRTC-enabled
telecom service.

It's FreeSWITCH binaries,
a Django configuration server,
a FreeSWITCH verto protocol JavaScript client,
and Ansible roles
to install the service
on a Debian 10 host.
