Docs for the PBX project.

This project brings together
a few stable, mature, high-quality
open source projects
with the goal of developing
a simple,
secure,
single-server,
self-hostable
WebRTC-enabled
telecom service.

It's FreeSWITCH binaries,
a Django configuration server,
a FreeSWITCH verto protocol JavaScript client,
and Ansible roles
to install the service
on a Debian 10 host.

Take note of licenses.
You can copy and install it
to your heart's content,
but you can't modify it
and you can't make money from it
without my consent.
