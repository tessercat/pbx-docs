Docs for the WebRTC PBX project.
  
The project uses the
[pbx-web](https://github.com/tessercat/pbx-web)
Django call control server
and the
[pbx-peer](https://github.com/tessercat/pbx-peer)
JavaScript client
to provide as simple a
peer-to-peer WebRTC calling service
as I can manage.

Ansible roles to deploy the call control server
are in the
[pbx-deploy](https://github.com/tessercat/pbx-deploy)
repo.
