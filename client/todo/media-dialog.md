The client should provide
a simple means
for people to select
audio/video input/output media options.

- Select audio input source
  from the set of all audio input devices.
- Select video input source
  from the set of all video input devices,
  plus a "screen" option
  that triggers the browser to 
  and display media sources.
- Select audio output sink
  from the set of all audio output devices,
  if possible.

I don't know
when this dialog should be visible,
but I'm thinking of
starting connections with default media
and once user media is initialized,
showing a "Media" button
along with the "Close" button.
