Make a sound
and maybe flash the favicon
when there's a call to answer.

The only problem with this
is that now we need
some way to manage settings
to enable/disable the audio ringer
and ignore offers.

Maybe it makes sense
for the nav menu to slide out
a box of menu items instead,
one of which is a checkbox
to enable/disable ringer sound
when an offer is active.
