# Add client name feature

Allow the view to set
a user-configurable client name
instead of showing truncated client ID
in the view status message label.

If there's no client name in localStorage
for a particular channel
when the client logs in to the channel,
show a client-name entry dialog when a client
pre-populated with the truncated client ID.

If a client name is already in localStorage
when the client logs in to the channel,
show the client-name dialog
pre-populated with the existing value.

Validate client name somehow
in the entry dialog.

The cient-name dialog's
pre-populated value is highlighted,
the input item is selected,
and there's an enter key listener
on the input item
so it's easy for the user
to type in a new name from scratch
or just hit enter
to accept the existing value.

Pop up the client-name entry dialog
when the client name/ID label is clicked.

Store client name by channel
in browser local storage
so a client has a different name
for each channel it can access.

Send client names
in channel presence messages.

Show client names
in the peers dialog.

Clients must somehow validate
received client names.
