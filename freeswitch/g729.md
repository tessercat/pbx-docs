Clone the project binaries repo to `/opt/<project>/freeswitch`
and the prep FreeSWITCH build environment as per
[Debian 10 Buster](https://freeswitch.org/confluence/display/FREESWITCH/Debian+10+Buster),
including boostrap and configure,
though it's not necessary to make FreeSWITCH itself.

Clone the g729 FreeSWITCH module repo.

    cd /usr/local/src
    git clone https://github.com/xadhoom/mod_bcg729.git
    cd mod_bcg729

Edit the `Makefile` and set the following:

    FS_INCLUDES=/usr/local/src/freeswitch/src/include
    FS_MODULES=/opt/<project>/freeswitch/mod

And add `libeteletone` to the end of the INCLUDES= line so it looks like this:

    INCLUDES=-I/usr/include -Ibcg729/include -I$(FS_INCLUDES) -I/usr/local/src/freeswitch/libs/libteletone/src 

Make and install the module.

    make
    make install
